# js-nacl: Pure-Javascript High-level API to Emscripten-compiled libsodium routines

A high-level Javascript API wrapping an
[Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten)-compiled
[libsodium](http://libsodium.org/), a cryptographic library based on
[NaCl](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/). Includes both in-browser and node.js
support.

The paper "[The security impact of a new cryptographic
library](http://cr.yp.to/highspeed/coolnacl-20120725.pdf)" is an
excellent summary of the motivation behind the NaCl API and library
design.

Using this library in the browser requires support for the newish
`window.crypto.getRandomValues` API.

**WARNING**: This code will not run in Safari version 5.1.x; or, at
least, will not run when Safari's Javascript debug mode is *disabled*.
Symptoms include corruption during hash calculation, failures when
unboxing, and failures when producing and verifying signatures. Safari
7.0 seems to be just fine, however. I don't know exactly at which
version Safari started working: I don't have access to enough of a
range of systems. The code has run fine on Chrome and Firefox across
all the versions I've tried.

## Changes

Version 1.4.0: Updated from libsodium stable-2018-11-19 to 1.0.18-stable.

Version 1.3.2: The Emscripten-compiled code is now configured so that
it no longer adds a listener to the `uncaughtException` when running
in node.js. See issue #46.

Version 1.3.1: Correct a minor packaging error.

Version 1.3.0: Updated from libsodium 1.0.11 to stable-2018-11-19.
Added `crypto_box_seal` and `crypto_box_seal_open`. Switched from
using the Emscripten SDK to using a Dockerized Emscripten to produce
the built version of the library. Because this enables WASM by
default, the approach to handling of `requested_total_memory` is now
different; see below.

Version 1.2.2: Updated from libsodium 1.0.10 to 1.0.11.

Version 1.2.1: Repaired a mistake where I had failed to export the new
names `crypto_sign_seed_keypair` and `crypto_box_seed_keypair`.

Version 1.2.0: js-nacl is now based around libsodium rather than the
plain NaCl tarball. Functions `crypto_sign_keypair_from_seed` and
`crypto_box_keypair_from_seed` have been renamed to their libsodium
names, `crypto_sign_seed_keypair` and `crypto_box_seed_keypair`
respectively; the old names are still available as aliases, though
**deprecated**, to be removed in a future version.

Version 1.1.0: **API change.** The `nacl_factory.instantiate` function
now expects a callback as its first argument. It calls the callback
with the `nacl` instance containing the API functions, and returns no
useful value.

Version 0.5.0: **API change.** Instead of being provided with a module
`nacl`, with API functions available directly, library importers are
given `nacl_factory` with a single function `instantiate`, which
returns a `nacl` instance containing the API functions.

## NPM Package

This library is [registered on
npmjs.org](https://npmjs.org/package/js-nacl). To install it:

    npm install js-nacl

## Building the library

The git checkout includes a pre-compiled version of the library, so
you won't need Emscripten unless you want to change something about
the underlying C-language library itself.

Essentially, the source checkout contains everything you will need to
use the library in both the browser and in node.js.

If you do find yourself wanting to build the library, see the
instructions in
[BUILDING.md](https://github.com/tonyg/js-nacl/blob/master/BUILDING.md).

## Using the library

In the browser, include the `lib/nacl_factory.js` script:

    <script src="lib/nacl_factory.js"></script>
    ...
    <script>
      nacl_factory.instantiate(function (nacl) {
        alert(nacl.to_hex(nacl.random_bytes(16)));
      });
    </script>

In node.js, require the `lib/nacl_factory.js` module:

    var nacl_factory = require("./lib/nacl_factory.js");
    nacl_factory.instantiate(function (nacl) {
      ...
      console.log(nacl.to_hex(nacl.random_bytes(16)));
    });

Or if you have installed the library via `npm`,

    var nacl_factory = require("js-nacl");
    nacl_factory.instantiate(function (nacl) {
      ...
      console.log(nacl.to_hex(nacl.random_bytes(16)));
    });

In addition, since version 1.3.0, the `instantiate` function returns a
`Promise` that yields the `nacl` object.

## Instantiating the NaCl module

Pass `nacl_factory.instantiate` a callback function expecting a single
argument, the `nacl` module instance.

The `nacl_factory.instantiate` function expects also a second optional
argument, a dictionary of optional configuration values.

Each call to `nacl_factory.instantiate()` creates an entirely fresh
module instance, complete with its own private heap area. **Since
v1.3.0:** The heap should automatically grow as required, and should
no longer require manual ahead-of-time configuration.

It's fine to instantiate the module more than once in a single
program, though beware of the large amount of memory potentially taken
up by each instance. The memory assigned to each module instance will
not be released until the instance is garbage collected.

If you notice memory leaks across multiple uses of a *single* module
instance, please report them, with a test case if at all possible.

## Strings vs. Binary Data

The library enforces a strict distinction between strings and binary
data. Binary data is represented using instances of
[`Uint8Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Typed_arrays/Uint8Array).

### nacl.to_hex(Uint8Array) → String

Returns a lower-case hexadecimal representation of the given binary
data.

### nacl.from_hex(String) → Uint8Array

Converts a lower- or upper-case hexadecimal representation of binary
data into the equivalent Uint8Array.

### nacl.encode_utf8(String) → Uint8Array

Returns the binary equivalent of the argument, encoded using UTF-8.

### nacl.encode_latin1(String) → Uint8Array

Returns the binary equivalent of the argument, encoded using Latin1
(an 8-bit clean encoding). If any of the character codes in the
argument string are greater than 255, an exception is thrown.

### nacl.decode_utf8(Uint8Array) → String

Decodes the binary data in the argument using the UTF-8 encoding,
producing the corresponding string.

### nacl.decode_latin1(Uint8Array) → String

Decodes the binary data in the argument using the Latin1 8-bit clean
encoding, producing the corresponding string.

## Hashing: crypto_hash

Follows the [NaCl crypto_hash API](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/hash.html).

### nacl.crypto\_hash(Uint8Array) → Uint8Array

Computes the SHA-512 hash of its argument.

While SHA-512 is recommended, the SHA-256 function is also available,
as `nacl.crypto\_hash\_sha256`.

### nacl.crypto\_hash\_string(String) → Uint8Array

Encodes its argument using `nacl.encode_utf8`, and then calls
`crypto_hash`.

## Public-key authenticated encryption: crypto_box

Follows the [NaCl crypto_box API](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/box.html).

You do not need to perform any padding of any arguments to these
functions; the API given here is most similar to the "C++" API in the
NaCl documentation.

**Make sure to follow the instructions regarding nonce selection given
in the "Security model" section of the NaCl API documentation!**

    senderKeypair = nacl.crypto_box_keypair();
    recipientKeypair = nacl.crypto_box_keypair();
    message = nacl.encode_utf8("Hello!");

    nonce = nacl.crypto_box_random_nonce();
    packet = nacl.crypto_box(message, nonce, recipientKeypair.boxPk, senderKeypair.boxSk);

    decoded = nacl.crypto_box_open(packet, nonce, senderKeypair.boxPk, recipientKeypair.boxSk);

    "Hello!" === nacl.decode_utf8(decoded); // always true

### nacl.crypto\_box\_keypair() → {"boxPk": Uint8Array, "boxSk": Uint8Array}

Creates a fresh random keypair. `boxPk` is the public key and `boxSk`
is the secret key.

### nacl.crypto\_box\_random\_nonce() → Uint8Array

Returns a fresh randomly-chosen nonce suitable for use with
`crypto_box`.

### nacl.crypto\_box(msgBin, nonceBin, recipientPublicKeyBin, senderSecretKeyBin) → Uint8Array

Places `msg` in an authenticated, encrypted box that can only be
verified and decrypted by the secret key corresponding to
`recipientPublicKey`.

### nacl.crypto\_box\_open(ciphertextBin, nonceBin, senderPublicKeyBin, recipientSecretKeyBin) → Uint8Array

Verifies and decrypts a box from `crypto_box`. Throws an exception if
the verification fails or any of the inputs are invalid.

### nacl.crypto\_box\_precompute(publicKeyBin, secretKeyBin) → {"boxK": Uint8Array}

Precomputes a shared secret between two parties. See the documentation
for `crypto_box_beforenm` at the NaCl website.

### nacl.crypto\_box\_precomputed(msgBin, nonceBin, {"boxK": Uint8Array}) → Uint8Array<br>nacl.crypto\_box\_open\_precomputed(ciphertextBin, nonceBin, {"boxK": Uint8Array}) → Uint8Array

Precomputed-secret variants of `crypto_box` and `crypto_box_open`.

## Secret-key authenticated encryption: crypto_secretbox

Follows the [NaCl crypto_secretbox API](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/secretbox.html).

You do not need to perform any padding of any arguments to these
functions; the API given here is most similar to the "C++" API in the
NaCl documentation.

**Make sure to follow the instructions regarding nonce selection given
in the "Security model" section of the NaCl API documentation!**

    k = ...;
    m = nacl.encode_utf8("message");
    n = nacl.crypto_secretbox_random_nonce();
    c = nacl.crypto_secretbox(m, n, k);
    m1 = nacl.crypto_secretbox_open(c, n, k);
    "message" === nacl.decode_utf8(m1); // always true
    
### nacl.crypto\_secretbox\_keygen() → Uint8Array

Generates a random key buffer.

### nacl.crypto\_secretbox\_random\_nonce() → Uint8Array

Returns a fresh randomly-chosen nonce suitable for use with
`crypto_secretbox`.

### nacl.crypto\_secretbox(msgBin, nonceBin, keyBin) → Uint8Array

Places `msg` in an authenticated, encrypted box that can only be
verified and decrypted by someone who knows `keyBin`. The `keyBin`
Uint8Array must be `nacl.crypto_secretbox_KEYBYTES` bytes long.

### nacl.crypto\_secretbox\_open(ciphertextBin, nonceBin, keyBin) → Uint8Array

Verifies and decrypts a packet from `crypto_secretbox`. Throws an
exception if the verification fails or any of the inputs are invalid.

## Anonymous authenticated encryption: crypto_box_seal

Uses a freshly-created ephemeral box keypair to send an "anonymous"
message to a specific recipient, who is identified by their public box
key, and who may decrypt the message using the matching box keypair.

### nacl.crypto\_box\_seal(msgBin, recipientPublicKeyBin) → Uint8Array

Places `msgBin` in an authenticated, encrypted box that can only be
verified and decrypted by the secret key corresponding to
`recipientPublicKeyBin`.

### nacl.crypto\_box\_seal\_open(ciphertextBin, recipientPublicKeyBin, recipientSecretKeyBin) → Uint8Array

Verifies and decrypts a box from `crypto_box_seal`. Throws an
exception if the verification fails or any of the inputs are invalid.
Unlike `crypto_box_open`, no nonce is required, and the *recipient's*
public key is supplied instead of the *sender's*. The sender remains
anonymous.

## Secret-key encryption: crypto_stream

Follows the [NaCl crypto_stream API](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/stream.html).

**Make sure to follow the instructions regarding nonce selection given
in the "Security model" section of the NaCl API documentation!**

Since this style of secret-key encryption is symmetric,
`nacl.crypto_stream_xor` is suitable for decryption as well as
encryption:

    k = ...;
    m = nacl.encode_utf8("message");
    n = nacl.crypto_stream_random_nonce();
    c = nacl.crypto_stream_xor(m, n, k);
    m1 = nacl.crypto_stream_xor(c, n, k);
    "message" === nacl.decode_utf8(m1); // always true

### nacl.crypto\_stream\_random\_nonce() → Uint8Array

Returns a fresh randomly-chosen nonce suitable for use with
`crypto_stream`.

### nacl.crypto\_stream(lenInt, nonceBin, keyBin) → Uint8Array

Returns a `lenInt`-byte length keystream based on the given nonce and
key. The key must be `nacl.crypto_stream_KEYBYTES` bytes long.

### nacl.crypto\_stream\_xor(msgBin, nonceBin, keyBin) → Uint8Array

Returns `msgBin.length` bytes of ciphertext (or plaintext, depending
on the contents of `msgBin`) produced by XORing `msgBin` with the
result of `nacl.crypto_stream(msgBin.length, nonceBin, keyBin)`.

## Secret-key single-message authentication: crypto_onetimeauth

Follows the [NaCl crypto_onetimeauth API](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/onetimeauth.html).

## Secret-key message authentication: crypto_auth

Follows the [NaCl crypto_auth API](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/auth.html).

## Signatures: crypto_sign

Follows the [NaCl crypto_sign API](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/sign.html).

Note that this uses the version of [Ed25519](http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/)
from [SUPERCOP](http://bench.cr.yp.to/supercop.html), and *not* the
old prototype implementation from the nacl 20110221 release.

The SUPERCOP Ed25519 signature scheme used is compatible with
libsodium and most other bindings and wrappers of libsodium and nacl.

### nacl.crypto\_sign\_keypair() → {"signPk": Uint8Array, "signSk": Uint8Array}

Creates a fresh random keypair. `signPk` is the public key and
`signSk` is the secret key.

    k = nacl.crypto_sign_keypair();
    m = nacl.encode_utf8("message");
    signed_m = nacl.crypto_sign(m, k.signSk);
    m1 = nacl.crypto_sign_open(signed_m, k.signPk);
    "message" === nacl.decode_utf8(m1); // always true

### nacl.crypto\_sign(msgBin, signerSecretKey) → Uint8Array

Produces a signature-wrapped version of `msgBin`.

### nacl.crypto\_sign\_open(packetBin, signerPublicKey) → (Uint8Array || null)

Verifies the signature on the given `packetBin`, and if it is valid,
extracts the carried message and returns it. If the signature could
not be verified, returns `null`.

### nacl.crypto\_sign\_detached(msgBin, signerSecretKey) → Uint8Array

**WARNING: Experimental.** Produces a "detached" signature that,
unlike `crypto_sign`, excludes the actual message body. The result can
be used with `crypto_sign_verify_detached`.

The returned detached signature will be `nacl.crypto_sign_BYTES` in
length.

### nacl.crypto\_sign\_verify\_detached(detachedSignatureBin, msgBin, signerPublicKey) → (true || false)

**WARNING: Experimental.** Given a "detached" signature from
`crypto_sign_detached`, along with the original message and the
signer's public signing key, returns `true` if the signature is valid,
and `false` otherwise.

## Argon2 password hashing

### nacl.crypto\_pwhash(passwordStr, saltBin, time, memory, nacl.crypto_pwhash_argon2i | nacl.crypto_pwhash_argon2d | nacl.crypto_pwhash_argon2id) → Uint8Array  

Computes the Argon2 password hash of the password.

## Derived Keys

**WARNING: Experimental**

If you see yourself wanting to use these, you will need to know why
[PBKDF2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) and
[scrypt](http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html) are of crucial
importance; or use Argon2 (above).

You might like to explore the use of these functions in tandem with
`scrypt.crypto_scrypt` from
[js-scrypt](https://github.com/tonyg/js-scrypt).

It is not generally safe to supply (for example) a user's passphrase
directly to these procedures without using PBKDF2, scrypt or something
similar beforehand.

### nacl.crypto\_sign\_seed\_keypair(Uint8Array) → {"signPk": Uint8Array, "signSk": Uint8Array}

Produces a *signing* keypair from its argument. A given binary input
will always produce the same keypair as output.

The input must be 32 bytes long. As
[Brian Warner puts it](https://blog.mozilla.org/warner/2011/11/29/ed25519-keys/),
"Ed25519 keys start life as a 32-byte (256-bit) uniformly random
binary seed" such as might be produced by sha256, or better yet,
PBKDF2 or scrypt.

Make sure to read and understand the warnings relating to passphrases,
PBKDF2 and scrypt at the beginning of this section.

Compatible with [PyNaCl](https://github.com/warner/pynacl)'s
`crypto_sign_keypair_fromseed` and
[racl](https://github.com/tonyg/racl)'s `bytes->crypto-sign-keypair`.

(Prior to v1.2.0, known as `nacl.crypto_sign_keypair_from_seed`.)

### nacl.crypto\_box\_seed\_keypair(Uint8Array) → {"boxPk": Uint8Array, "boxSk": Uint8Array}

Produces an *encrypted authenticated box* keypair from its argument. A
given binary input will always produce the same keypair as output.

The input may be of any length. The input is hashed once with sha512,
and the first 32 bytes of the result are taken as the 32-byte secret
key, which is then passed to `nacl.crypto_box_keypair_from_raw_sk`.

Make sure to read and understand the warnings relating to passphrases,
PBKDF2 and scrypt at the beginning of this section.

Compatible with [racl](https://github.com/tonyg/racl)'s
`bytes->crypto-box-keypair`.

(Prior to v1.2.0, known as `nacl.crypto_box_keypair_from_seed`.)

### nacl.crypto\_box\_keypair\_from\_raw\_sk(Uint8Array) → {"boxPk": Uint8Array, "boxSk": Uint8Array}

Produces an *encrypted authenticated box* keypair from its argument. A
given binary input will always produce the same keypair as output.

The input must be 32 bytes long, and could be a random 32-byte value,
or the output of sha256, or better yet, the output of PBKDF2 or
scrypt.

Make sure to read and understand the warnings relating to passphrases,
PBKDF2 and scrypt at the beginning of this section.

Compatible with [racl](https://github.com/tonyg/racl)'s
`crypto-box-sk->pk`.

## Low-level tools

### nacl.crypto\_scalarmult(Uint8Array, Uint8Array) → Uint8Array

Expects two binaries, the first of length
`nacl.crypto_scalarmult_SCALARBYTES` (representing an integer), and
the second of length `nacl.crypto_scalarmult_BYTES` (representing a
group element). The two are multiplied using the underlying NaCl
`crypto_scalarmult` primitive, and the resulting
`nacl.crypto_scalarmult_BYTES`-length group element binary is
returned.

### nacl.crypto\_scalarmult\_base(Uint8Array) → Uint8Array

As `nacl.crypto_scalarmult`, but multiplies the
`nacl.crypto_scalarmult_SCALARBYTES`-length argument by a standard
group element, returning the result.
